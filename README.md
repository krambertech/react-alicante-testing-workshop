# 🔍 Testing React Aplications

This a workshop that covers the basics of testing React applications. 

## 🌱 Setup

I recommend setup this project before the workshop. 

Just follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start dev server with playground `npm start`

## 💡 Tasks

Links to all of the tasks:

1. [Fundamentals of testing](src/1.2-fundamentals-task/calculator.test.js)
2. [Testing React components](src/2.2-counter-task/Counter.test.jsx)
3. [Testing React components with async](src/3.2-quote-generation-task/QuoteGenerator.test.jsx)
4. [Integration testing](src/4-testing-application/screens/MyMusings.test.jsx)
5. [Testing reusable component](src/4-testing-application/components/Modal.test.jsx)
6. [Testing hooks](src/4-testing-application/hooks/useHotKey.test.js)
7. [E2e testing with Cypress](cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.js)

In files of tasks you will find instructions and hints in code comments. Each task also has the solution defined, it is within the `__solution__` folder. This folder is skipped during the test runs, but you are welcome to check out the code if you feel stuck.

## 🗂 Navigate

In this repo inside `/src` folder you will find representing each part of the workshop.
