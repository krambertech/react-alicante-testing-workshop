# Testing React Aplications

This a workshop that covers the basics of testing React apps. The workshop is in 4 parts:

1. *available* Fundamentals of testing and testing JavaScript
2. *available* Testing React components
3. *coming* Applying everything we learned to test React application
4. *coming* E2E testing with Cypress

## 🌱 Setup

I recommend setup this project before the workshop. Just follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start dev server with playground `npm start`

## 🗂 Navigate

In this repo inside `/src` folder you will find folders representing each part of te workshop.

```
📁 01-testing-javascript
📁 02-testing-react
📁 03-application (coming soon ✨)
📁 04-e2e (coming soon ✨)
```

Each part has its own `README.md` file that has:
- the summary of everything covered during the lecture
- description of all practical tasks
- link to the quiz that can help all the new information to settle better and provide feedback for me

Also you can find there all exercises and examples that we covered during the lecture, plus, blueprints for you to work on tasks.

Each task also has the solution inside, it is within the `__solution__` folder. This folder is skipped during the test runs, but you are welcome to ckeck out the solution if you feel stuck.

In task files, you will also find comments and tips that can help you complete or direct you to the important parts of documentation.
