# 🔍 Testing React Aplications

This a workshop that covers the basics of testing React apps. 

The workshop is in 3 modules:
1. [Fundamentals of testing and testing JavaScript](src/1-testing-js)
2. [Testing React components](src/2-testing-react-components)
3. [Testing React application](src/3-testing-application)

## 🌱 Setup

I recommend setup this project before the workshop. Just follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start dev server with playground `npm start`

## 🗂 Navigate

In this repo inside `/src` folder you will find folders representing each module of the workshop.

```
📁 0-testing-javascript
📁 1-testing-react-cpmponents
📁 2-testing-application
```

Each part has its own `README.md` file that has:
- the summary of everything covered during the lecture
- description of all practical tasks

Also you can find there all exercises and examples that we covered during the lecture, plus, blueprints for you to work on tasks.

Each task also has the solution defined, it is within the `__solution__` folder. This folder is skipped during the test runs, but you are welcome to check out the code if you feel stuck.
