// 👉 TASK: Cover `toCamelCase` with a set of tests
//
// Here you would need to think about the suites yourself.
// Given the function itself, what are the important cases to cover?
//
// Run tests with:
//   npm test toCamelCase

import toCamelCase from "./toCamelCase";

test.todo("your test");

// Good luck 🍀
