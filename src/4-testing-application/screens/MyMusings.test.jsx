 * - MyMusings component
 * - NewMusing component
 * - Musing component
 * - Modal component
 * - several utils and hooks
 *
 * With one test! Wow!
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Tips:
 * - You would need to mock 2 API calls (getMyMusings and createMusing)
 * - In `test/mocks` you can already find mocks for the returned data,
 *   you can just use `mockMusing` to generate a mock

  // Test scenario:
  // 1. First, wait until the existing list of items is displayed.
  // 2. Then, click on the "New musing" button.
  // 3. Then, wait until the dialog (you can use role `dialog`) is displayed.
  // 4. Then, fill in the input (label: Write something) and click on the "Save" button.
  // 5. Then, wait until the dialog is closed (Tip: you  can use `waitForElementToBeRemoved`).
  // 6. Then, wait until the new item is displayed in the list.
  // 7. Then, check that API has been called correctly

 * - To get a list of elements, you can use `getAllByTestId` and then find the element in the array
 * - To find specific delete button, you can use `within` helper to narrow selection down
