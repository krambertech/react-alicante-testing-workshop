/**
 * 👉 TASK: Write tests for `calculator` function
 * make sure to cover different cases in your tests
 *
 * When working on tests you might find it useful to try
 * and break your code and see how tests react
 *
 * Run your tests with:
 * > npm test calculator
 */

import calculator from "./calculator";

/**
 * Check that it can correctly adds numbers,
 * make sure to cover different cases: positive, negative, zero etc
 */
test("adds numbers", () => {});

/**
 * Check that it can correctly subtract numbers,
 * make sure to cover different cases: positive, negative, zero etc
 */
test("subtracts numbers", () => {});

/**
 * 🚀 BONUS
 * Check that it throws an error if operation is not supported
 *
 * 💡 Tip: You can use `toThrow` matcher
 * https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tothrowerror
 */
// test("throws error when operation is unsupported", () => {});

/**
 * 🚀 BONUS (TDD)
 * Let's try TDD! First, write a test for "multiply" operation, it should be red
 * Then implement it in the calculator functionuntil it is green
 *
 * Example:
 * calculator("multiply", 1, 2) -> 2
 */
// test("multiplies numbers", () => {});

/**
 * 🚀 BONUS (TDD)
 * Make sure that calculator function throws an error if it receives not numbers
 * as input
 *
 * Example:
 * calculator("add", [], "2") -> Error
 */
// test("throws error when input is not a number", () => {});

// Good luck 🍀
