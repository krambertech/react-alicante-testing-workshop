// Exercise 2: Cover `toCamelCase` with set of tests
//
// Here you would need to think about the suites yourself.
// Given the function itself, what are the important cases to cover?
//
// Run tests with:
//   npm test 02.toCamelCase

import toCamelCase from "./02.toCamelCase";

test("your test", () => {
  // Implement me!
});
